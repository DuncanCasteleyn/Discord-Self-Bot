# Discord self bot
Discord self bot is an easy to use interface that provides a self bot programmed in the c# language.

You simply run the program, it retrieves your token from the local storage and press connect. The application will then go to the background and you can execute commands in diferent channels. The self bot only responds to you other people that execute commands are ignored, like a self bot should work.

The bot is a work in progress and uses the Discord.Net library see https://discord.foxbot.me/docs/index.html for more information.
